# nfsu2-textures
This project plans to collect unpacked HD textures from Need for Speed 2 Underground texture packs, tools to unpack other packs, and eventually new textures.

Eventually the aim is to create small texture packs that change specific sets of textures, for example.
- Hud
- Map hud icons
- Shop, race, cash and information markers
- Roads
- Trees, plants and grass
- Text
- Traffic
- Menu icons and borders
- Barrier arrows and area barriers
- Crowds
- Advertisements and branding

The focus should be on textures that are unobtusive (no in game name dropping) and match the style of the original, but I will accept all textures and will group them as alternative styles.

If you want specifice texture pack added please let me know.
I may even accept texture packs from other nfs games.
